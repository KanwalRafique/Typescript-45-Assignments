// Question 12, Greetings:
// Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[] = ["Aamna", "Aroosa","Seema", "Ishmal"]

// Send message
let message: string = " Are you coming to my home for the birthday party of my Sister?"
console.log(names[0] + " " + message);
console.log(names[1] + " " + message);
console.log(names[2] + " " + message);
console.log(names[3] + " " + message);
