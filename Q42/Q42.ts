// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 41. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.



// function to show magicians' names

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name)
    );
}


//Modifying the function:
function make_great(magicians: string[]) {
    return magicians.map(magicians => `The Great ${magicians}`);
}

//Array of Magicians
let magicians_names = ["Harry Houdini", "David Blaine", "Dough Henning", "Dai Vernon"];

let great_magicians = make_great(magicians_names);

//calling function 
show_magicians(great_magicians);
