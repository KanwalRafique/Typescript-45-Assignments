// Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

//Array
let guestArray: string [] = ["Aroosa", "Seema", "Aamna"];

//Sending message:

guestArray.map((item)=> console.log(`Hello, ${item} you are invited for dinner`)
)
